## SuperWoW Features
If SuperWoW is installed, simpleAuras will automatically learn unkown durations of most auras with the first cast (needs to run out to be accurate).

Some Spells can't be properly tracked because they use different names during apply and fade (Enlighten -> Enlightened for example).

In those cases, use /sa learn X Y - manually set duration Y for aura with ID X.
