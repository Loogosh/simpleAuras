## Known Issues
- Learning new AuraDuration gets prematurely completed if another player's aura with the same name runs out on the same target before yours - no way to get casterID when an aura fades.
- Skills that apply Auras with the same name may show "learning" all the time (maybe this one is fixed now - wasn't able to test yet).
- Having more than 16 auras shows auras outside the GUI frame (scrollframe possible, but then has more/other issues)
- AddOn is kinda heavy on ressources (compared to other addons), will optimize in a future update.
- /sa learnall 1 tries to learn spells without aura (i.e. smite, shadowbolt, etc.)


## Console Commands:
/sa or /sa show or /sa hide - Show/hide simpleAuras Settings.

/sa refresh X - Set refresh rate. (1 to 10 updates per second. Default: 5).
It only affects the data update time, the GUI is always drawn at 20

### SuperWoW commands:
/sa learn X Y - manually set duration Y of spellID X.

/sa forget X - forget AuraDuration of SpellID X (or use 'all' instead to delete all durations).

/sa update X - force AuraDurations updates (1 = re-learn aura durations. Default: 0).

/sa showlearning X - shows learning of new AuraDurations in chat (1 = show. Default: 0).

/sa learnall X - learn all AuraDurations, even if no Aura is set up. (1 = Active. Default: 0).

\* = For these functions to work on targets SuperWoW is REQUIRED! Also only shows your own AuraDurations.


## SuperWoW Features
If SuperWoW is installed, simpleAuras will automatically learn unkown durations of most of **your own** auras with the first cast (needs to run out to be accurate).

Some Spells aren't properly tracked because they use different names during apply and fade or don't trigger the event used to track them (Enlighten -> Enlightened and Weakened Soul for example).

In those cases, use "/sa learn X Y" to manually set duration Y for aura with ID X.
